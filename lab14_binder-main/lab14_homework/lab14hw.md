## Instructions
Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

A bachelor's degree is required for this career. 
It is a growing career - theres a 36% growth rate compared to an average of 5%.


2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

Intermediate knowledge of R software. Able to transform and organize data sets for analytical purposes. Can create visuals of data in the form of charts graphs and apps.

3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

My current career interest is to pursue a job in veterinary science. Howver, I am also interested in the research side 

4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?

The most difficult aspect for me was dealing with smaller errors in my code that got harder to detect as we worked on more complicated problems. However, the most rewarding thing is after working on an especially difficult problem and having the code turn out better than expected.

5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

I wish I had had more experience with computers, however, I didn't feel as I was lacking much as Dr. Ledford and Hannah made themselves readily available to help at every step of the process.

6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

With one more lab I would have like to learn about further tidying techniques. My partner and I ran into several issues when tidying our data for our project like. proper use of gsub which I think could benefit a lot of students.

7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to persue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

I really would like to continue pursuing knowledge of r but I am not sure of how to approach this other than practicing on my own and using google.

8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

I really enjoyed having a partner to work through things with. Whenever one of us had a gap in how to approach a certain problem, the other usually figured it out, or we would figure it out together. With an online format I think I would definitely be less engaged and more likely to fall behind.

9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.

yes!
